# Semantic Classification Matching

Match two classifications / list of texts, such as product names, industry names, etc. using an NLP (semantic similarity) approach, to get the top N matches in list B for every element in list A.

Code in `src/get_closest_match.py`, and usage example available in `src/test_script.ipynb`.
